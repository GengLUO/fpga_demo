# Demo 4: VCK5000 Exploration


This demo shows how to use the VCK5000 in HACC@NUS. We highly recommend you to use ```tmux``` for multiple tasking, which lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal.


## Compiling VCK5000 Project
HACC@NUS provides following software environment for the compilation and execution of VCK5000 program.

XRT:   __2.13.478__

Vitis: __2022.1__

Due the compatibility issues with other Alveo boards, we provide a separate compilation node for VCK5000. To use this node, simply run the following command:
```
./env/vck5000_compile
```

You will login to a node with VCK5000 software environment. To setup XRT and Vitis environment.
```
source ./env/vck5000_env
```

The terminal will print the toolchain version information like this:
```
{
  "BUILD_VERSION" : "2.13.478",
  "BUILD_VERSION_DATE" : "Mon, 16 May 2022 15:30:19 -0700",
  "BUILD_BRANCH" : "2022.1",
  "VERSION_HASH" : "458699e9617da693e354d95b637df38daa2ed40a",
  "VERSION_HASH_DATE" : "Mon, 16 May 2022 11:11:42 -0700"
}

/tools/Xilinx/Vitis/2022.1/bin/vitis
```


Then you can compile your project (e.g., the mixed kernel demo from the early access page).


## Run VCK5000 Program
To execute your VCK5000 program, you should allocate an idle VCK5000 compute node according ```sinfo``` 

For example, an output of ```sinfo``` like this:
```
PARTITION                         AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
cpu_only*                            up 7-00:00:00      1   idle hacc-node2
head                                 up 2-00:00:00      1   unk* hacchead
u50_standard_reservation_pool        up   12:00:00      1   idle hacc-u50-1
vck5000_standard_reservation_pool    up      20:00      1  alloc hacc-vck5000-1
vck5000_standard_reservation_pool    up      20:00      3   idle hacc-vck5000-[2-4]
vck5000_compile                      up 7-00:00:00      1    mix hacc-node0
u250_standard_reservation_pool       up   12:00:00      4   idle hacc-u250-[1-4]
```

It indicates that the board 1 is allocated by other users, and your available VCK5000 boards are board 2, 3 and 4. Suppose you want to allocate board 2, simply run:
```
./env/vck5000_alloc 2
```

Setup env:
```
source ./env/vck5000_env
```

Run the example:

```
./vck5000_example/vadd_aie ./vck5000_example/fpga.xclbin
```

__NOTE:__ The AI Engine of VCK5000 array is configured during the boot (through PLM) thus you can only run this single application. If you need to run another AIE graph during runtime then you would need to reboot the node. We provide an script to do the re-initialization:

In the case of:

- You have finished your program and want to exit.
- You want to run another AIE graph.
- Your PL kernels are stalled by an unknown reason.

Please run the following command in the allocated VCK5000 node.
```
./env/vck5000_exit
```

It may pop some error messages, feel free to ignore them. The node will be set to __down__ for two minutes, after that, it will be available for new allocation.
